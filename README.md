# DnD Combat Simulator
The project is a simplified version of a DND combat phase that simulates a turn-based game between two sides - the "good" and the "bad" characters. At the start of the game, the user can select up to five "good" characters, and the game generates a random number of "bad" characters. The characters are placed on a rectangular board of square tiles, where some are not "walkable." The turn order is determined by the initiative value, which is rolled at the beginning of the fight, and the characters take turns until one side is eliminated. Each character can do one of three actions - move and then use an action, use an action and then move, or move twice. The actions available to the character are attacking or casting a spell, and each character has its unique set of spells and equipment. The characters' movement and attack animations are not instantaneous but take time. When attacking or casting spells, the player rolls a D20 to determine if they hit the opposing character's armor class (AC). If the D20 + modifier is higher than the AC, they hit; otherwise, they miss. The damage of each weapon or spell varies, and the players can equip the characters with equipment from the provided list. The "bad" side is controlled by a rudimentary AI, and the game displays what happens on their turns. There are also saving throws, rolling with advantage or disadvantage, and bonus actions available to the characters. The project requires implementing a graph-like structure to represent the board and a simple AI for the "bad" characters.
